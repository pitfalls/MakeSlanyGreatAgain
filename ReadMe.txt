Hello Guys!
This is our repo for the course Softwarewissens Management and a lot of courses else.
We use this repo for our project in this course

IMPORTANT!!!!!! PLEASE READ THIS!!!

For a good TestCoverage you need a rooted Android device, becaus we send a root request to the system and then we
are able to deactivate the WLAN for deeper testing!
Additional our webhoster is unstable during the day, but it is really well @night and at @morning :)

Testcoverage.zip with the achived 95% coverage is uploaded for backup :)

Cheers
TeamHobbit
